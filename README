ios-kexec-utils
===============

A miscellany of utilities designed to help you bootstrap
another operating system on an iOS device. They're probably crap.

You deal with them. No support/warranty implied/given. 

Warning: there are severe caveats with this method.

Utilities included (and duplicated from opensn0w-X):

	* img3maker - Image3 file maker, needed for the decrypted boot chain.
	* ibsspatch - iBSS patcher for iOS 7, creates a generic patched iBSS for boot.
	* kloader - Image loader for the kernel, bootstraps custom image in RAM.
	* multi_kloader - Image loader for two images in memory. See source for boot
	                  protocol convention.

Using these utilities in unison will let you do awesome things.

(This is one of the last public projects I will push for now.
 Personal reasons, mainly stress related.)
